## 1. Docker — Fully Containerised

**Goal:** Both services run as independent Docker containers instead of as two processes on the host.

**What changed from the original plan:** the original plan said "no shared log file — SentinelAI reads target app logs via Docker SDK log stream." Once it came time to build it, that turned out to be the wrong call. The actual implementation keeps the log file, just moved into a shared Docker volume.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (current — Postgres/Redis come in their own steps below)
services:
  target-app:
    build: ./target_app
    ports: ["8000:8000"]
    environment:
      - LOG_PATH=/app/logs/app.log
    volumes:
      - log-data:/app/logs

  sentinel-agent:
    build: ./agent
    depends_on: [target-app]
    environment:
      - LOG_PATH=/app/logs/app.log
    volumes:
      - log-data:/app/logs:ro

volumes:
  log-data:
```

**Why a shared volume instead of Docker SDK log streaming?**

Two options were on the table for how the agent reads target-app logs once both run as containers:

1. **Shared named volume + file tailing (chosen).** Both containers mount the same `log-data` volume. `agent/log_collector.py` keeps tailing the file exactly as in Week 1 — only the path changed, via a `LOG_PATH` env var that defaults back to the Week 1 local path when unset (so local dev without Docker still works unmodified). The agent still only ever reads a file; it has no idea the target app is even running in a container.
2. **Docker SDK log streaming (`docker-py`).** The agent attaches directly to the target-app container's stdout via the Docker Engine API. This requires mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` into the agent container — which grants it control over the entire Docker daemon, not just visibility into the target app. It could inspect, stop, or start *any* container on the host.

Option 2 reads as more impressive on a resume line, but it actually violates this project's core architecture principle ("neither knows the other's internals") worse than the Week 1 log file ever did. A shared volume keeps the agent's knowledge of the target app limited to its log output — the same boundary Datadog respects when it observes a process from outside. Giving the agent root-equivalent access to the Docker daemon just to read logs is a much bigger trust boundary to cross for no real benefit at this stage of the project. The Docker SDK approach is worth revisiting only if a future requirement genuinely needs control-plane access — e.g., auto-restarting a crashed container — not for log reading alone.

**Why Docker now and not Week 1?** (unchanged from the original plan)
Week 1 proved the core logic works. Docker adds reproducibility and proper isolation. The order matters — prove correctness locally, then containerise. Adding Docker before the logic worked would have just added debugging complexity on top of an unproven system.

**Why `LOG_PATH` as an env var instead of hardcoding the container path?**
`target_app/logger.py` and `agent/log_collector.py` both defaulted to host-relative paths (`../logs/app.log` and `logs/app.log`) written for Week 1's "two processes on one machine" setup. Hardcoding the new container path (`/app/logs/app.log`) into the code would have broken local, non-Docker development. Reading the path from an env var with the Week 1 default as fallback means both workflows — bare `uvicorn`/`python` for fast local iteration, and `docker-compose up` for the real containerised run — work unmodified.

**Bug discovered during testing:** `sentinel-agent`'s incident alerts (`print()` statements in `log_collector.py`) never appeared in `docker compose logs`, even though the container was running and the log file was being written and read correctly. Cause: Python buffers stdout in fixed-size blocks when it isn't attached to a TTY — which is always true inside a container. The output wasn't lost, just sitting in a buffer that hadn't filled yet. Fixed by setting `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` on the `sentinel-agent` service. This is the same category of bug as the Week 1 structlog field-name mismatch — invisible until two systems are actually wired together and observed running, not something a unit test would catch.

## 2. PostgreSQL — Real Database

**Goal:** Replace `USERS_DB`/`INVENTORY` (in-memory dicts) with a real Postgres database, so failure modes that only exist in real databases — connection pool exhaustion, FK violations, deadlocks — become genuinely reproducible instead of simulated with `random.random()`.

### Driver: `asyncpg`, raw SQL, no ORM

Two real options: `asyncpg` (raw SQL, async-native) vs SQLAlchemy 2.0 async (ORM). Chose `asyncpg`. Reasons:
- **Direct pool control.** `asyncpg.create_pool(min_size=, max_size=)` lets the pool size itself be small and deliberate (`min_size=2, max_size=5` — see below), which is what makes pool exhaustion a real, reproducible failure under concurrent load rather than a coin flip. An ORM's pool is a layer further removed from this control.
- **Transparency for root-cause tracing.** The whole point of this project is reasoning about *why* something broke. Raw SQL means the future AI reasoning engine can read the exact query that failed; an ORM would generate that SQL implicitly, adding a layer to reverse-engineer.
- Consistent with the project's existing async-everywhere stance (FastAPI, `httpx` over `requests`).

An ORM + Alembic would be more resume-conventional, but the convenience (relationship modeling, migration tooling) isn't needed for 3 small, fixed tables — it would be complexity for its own sake.

### Schema: 3 tables, plain `init.sql`, no migrations tool

`users`, `items`, `orders` (see `db/init.sql`) — `orders` is new; Week 1 only ever mutated balance/stock in memory with no order history. Adding it gives:
- A real **foreign key constraint** (`orders.user_id → users.id`, `orders.item_name → items.name`) — directly enables the "FK violation" failure mode from the original Week 2 plan. MongoDB/NoSQL alternatives were considered and rejected here specifically because they have no FK concept — there'd be nothing to violate, and this failure mode would have to be faked in application code instead of coming from the database engine itself.
- Order history for the AI reasoning engine to trace later.

Schema is created once via Postgres's own `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` mechanism (plain SQL file, auto-run on first container start against an empty volume) rather than Alembic. The schema isn't expected to evolve mid-iteration — versioned migrations would be solving a problem this project doesn't have yet, the same reasoning Week 1 used to justify deferring Docker until the core logic worked.

### Connection pool: small and timed out on purpose

`min_size=2, max_size=5`, with `pool.acquire(timeout=3.0)` (`target_app/db.py`). A small pool means a 6th concurrent request genuinely has to wait for a connection to free up — real exhaustion, not simulated. The timeout turns "no connection available" into a controlled, catchable `DBPoolExhausted` exception instead of a request hanging forever.

**Honesty about manual verification:** tested with bursts of 20 and then 300 concurrent requests against `/users/{id}` — both returned all `200`s, no exhaustion triggered. This is expected, not a bug: each query is a single-row `SELECT` that completes in microseconds, so even 300 requests cycle through 5 connections faster than the 3-second timeout could ever be hit. The pool/timeout mechanism is correct by code inspection, but a one-off burst of fast queries can't actually produce sustained contention. Real verification of this failure mode is pending the traffic simulator (later this week), which can generate *sustained* concurrent load over time rather than a single burst — same "documented as a gap, not faked" approach as the `db_deadlock` caveat below.

### Mapping real Postgres failures onto the existing two-mode classifier

New events added to `agent/error_detector.py`'s existing `IMMEDIATE_ERRORS`/`THRESHOLD_ERRORS` sets — **no changes to the detector's logic itself**, which is a good sign the Week 1 classification design generalizes beyond simulated failures:

| Event | Class | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `order_failed_fk_violation` | immediate | a dangling reference is a real bug, not a transient blip |
| `db_pool_exhausted` | threshold | one slow moment under load is noise; a pattern means a real capacity problem |
| `db_deadlock` | threshold | Postgres's own deadlock detector already resolves a single deadlock by killing one transaction; only a recurring pattern signals real contention |
| `db_connection_error` | threshold | one connection blip (e.g. Postgres restarting) vs. a real outage |

`db_timeout` (the Week 1 simulated event) was removed from `THRESHOLD_ERRORS` since nothing emits it anymore — see below.

**`db.py` raises its own typed exceptions** (`DBPoolExhausted`, `DBConnectionError`, `DBDeadlock`, `DBForeignKeyViolation`) rather than letting `asyncpg`'s exception types leak into `main.py`. Same "clean contract between layers" reasoning as the `Incident` dataclass in Week 1 — `main.py` only needs to know these four names, never `asyncpg` internals.

**Honesty about `db_deadlock`:** a real Postgres deadlock needs two transactions acquiring the same rows in opposite order. `apply_order` always touches `items` → `users` → `orders` in that same order on every call, so this specific code path is unlikely to produce a genuine deadlock under normal load. The classification and handler are kept (defensive, matches the agreed design), but triggering it for real would need a second code path with reversed lock ordering — not built yet, flagged here rather than overclaimed.

### Removed the simulated `db_timeout`

Week 1's `get_user` had `if random.random() < 0.2: await asyncio.sleep(5)` to fake a DB timeout. Once Postgres is real, that randomness should come from genuine concurrency pressure on the connection pool, not a coin flip — keeping both would mean two unrelated things produce the same log event, which muddies what `db_timeout` actually means. Removed entirely; `db_pool_exhausted`/`db_connection_error` are now the only DB-failure events, and they only fire from real conditions.

### The intentional race condition (kept, not fixed)

`create_order` reads the user's balance and the item's stock (`db.get_user`, `db.get_item`), checks them in Python, *then* writes via `db.apply_order` — and nothing re-validates that read at write time. Two concurrent orders from the same user can both read "balance = 100," both pass the check, both write, both succeed — overdrawing the balance.

This is deliberate, not an oversight: this project's own Week 2 plan names this exact scenario as a planned root-cause demo for the AI reasoning engine ("root cause: balance update not atomic — race condition"). Fixing it now with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or an atomic conditional `UPDATE` would remove the bug the roadmap is counting on existing later. `apply_order`'s three internal writes (stock, balance, order insert) *are* wrapped in a transaction — that only prevents *this function* from partially applying (e.g. on a mid-write crash), it does not close the race with the earlier read, which is exactly where the intentional gap lives.

### Credentials: `.env`, gitignored, referenced by name only

`POSTGRES_USER`/`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`/`POSTGRES_DB` live in `.env` (gitignored) with `.env.example` committed as a placeholder template. `docker-compose.yml` and `target_app`'s `DATABASE_URL` reference these by `${VAR}` substitution — nothing in the codebase needs to know the actual values. For this project, the password's strength barely matters in practice (Postgres isn't exposed to the host or the internet — only `target-app`'s container can reach it over Docker's internal network), but the credentials/`.env` boundary is the actual safety mechanism regardless of exposure, which is why it's enforced anyway.

### Startup ordering: healthcheck, not just `depends_on`

`depends_on: postgres` alone only waits for the *container process* to start, not for Postgres to be ready to accept connections (it takes a couple seconds to initialize on a cold start). Without a healthcheck, `target-app` could start and immediately fail its first connection attempt. Fixed with a `pg_isready` healthcheck on the `postgres` service and `depends_on: postgres: condition: service_healthy` on `target-app`.

## 3. AI Reasoning Engine

**Goal:** When an incident's log line names *what* broke but not *why*, hand it to an LLM-backed pipeline that reads the actual code, proposes a root cause with a confidence score, and drafts a fix for a human to review. Never auto-applies anything.

### Why most incidents never reach the AI at all

Building this surfaced a real design flaw worth naming directly: by default, `requires_ai` had been set to `True` on every immediate/critical incident, including fully self-explanatory ones (`user_not_found` — the log line *is* the root cause). Calling an LLM on those would be decorative, not useful, and would undermine the project's own "AI debug agent" framing rather than support it.

`AI_WORTHY_EVENTS` in `error_detector.py` now narrows this to exactly the cases where the log names the symptom but not the cause:
- `negative_balance_detected` — visible that the balance went negative, not *why* (requires reading the non-atomic check-then-write gap in `db.py`/`main.py`)
- `analytics_failed` — visible that it's a `ZeroDivisionError`, not *which* variable or *why* it's structurally always zero (requires reading `main.py`)
- any confirmed cascade pattern — "is this real causation or coincidence" is a genuine hypothesis question the detector can flag but not answer

`db_pool_exhausted`/`db_deadlock`/`db_connection_error` were deliberately left out: pool exhaustion *could* be AI-worthy (it can mean either genuine capacity pressure or a slow query/leak masking real capacity — a real ambiguity), but no instrumentation exists yet (e.g. per-connection hold-time logging) to give an LLM more to reason with than the bare event already says. Revisit once that instrumentation exists, rather than marking it AI-worthy prematurely.

**A flagship trigger had a real gap that had to be fixed first:** the intentional balance race condition (kept deliberately non-atomic, see section 2 above) previously produced a *silent* data-integrity bug — two concurrent orders could overdraw a balance with no log event marking it as wrong, meaning there was no incident to ever hand off to AI in the first place. `db.apply_order` now returns the post-write balance via `UPDATE ... RETURNING`, and `create_order` logs `negative_balance_detected` when it goes negative — detected after the fact, not prevented; the race itself stays intentional. Verified for real: two genuinely concurrent orders against a user's exact balance both succeeded, balance went negative, and the agent raised an immediate incident showing both interleaved `creating_order` calls in context.

### Multi-agent, not a single LLM call

> Original design below was 3 agents; consolidated to 2 after testing — see "Then consolidated 3 agents down to 2" further down for why and what changed. Kept here as the record of the original reasoning, not the current state.

Three CrewAI agents, run sequentially, each with one responsibility:
1. **Retrieval agent** — reads relevant source files via a custom `read_source_file` tool, restricted to the target app's source directory only (filename basename only, no path traversal).
2. **Hypothesis agent** — given the incident summary and retrieved code, states the most likely root cause with a confidence score, explicitly allowed to say "ambiguous" rather than overclaim.
3. **Fix-proposal agent** — drafts a small code diff and plain-English explanation, explicitly instructed to state it is a *proposal requiring human review*, not an applied change.

Chosen over a single call because each step is a genuinely distinct responsibility (reading code vs. diagnosing vs. proposing a fix), and over hand-rolled orchestration because the three-agent shape matches the project's own multi-agent design intent more directly than assembling it from raw SDK calls. LLM: OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini` — root-cause text generation doesn't need a flagship model; swap the `LLM_MODEL` constant in `ai_engine.py` if a cheaper/newer model becomes available).

**A real bug found during first live test: the retrieval agent guessed filenames instead of discovering them.** First end-to-end run, the fix-proposal agent returned a plausible-looking diff referencing functions that don't exist anywhere in this codebase (`get_balance`, `place_order`, `log_error`) — it had hallucinated a generic "race condition fix" rather than reasoning about the actual code. Traced it to the retrieval agent: given only `read_source_file` (which takes a filename), it guessed `order_processing.py`, then `logging.py`, both wrong (real files: `main.py`, `db.py`, `logger.py`) — it had no way to discover what files actually exist, only guess from naming convention. By the third guess it stumbled onto `main.py`, but the wasted attempts (and the model's limited reasoning budget) meant the final answer still wasn't well grounded.

**Fix:** added a `list_source_files` tool the retrieval agent must call first, and tightened all three task descriptions to explicitly require quoting real code verbatim and explicitly forbid inventing function/variable names — including telling the hypothesis/fix agents to say "evidence insufficient" rather than fabricate a plausible-sounding answer. Re-tested: the retrieval agent listed the real directory, read `main.py` correctly on the first attempt, and the fix-proposal's diff correctly referenced the real `db.apply_order` function and correctly diagnosed the actual root cause (order applied, balance never re-validated afterward) — still not 100% verbatim (invented one non-existent helper, `db.get_user_balance`), but a genuine, substantively correct diagnosis rather than hallucinated filler. This is the expected ceiling for a cheap mini-model with a small reasoning budget — usable as a real v1, not pretending to be perfect.

**Then consolidated 3 agents down to 2.** Worth being honest about a tradeoff here: 3 sequential agents (retrieval, hypothesis, fix-proposal) meant 3 LLM round-trips, compounding token cost (each agent's prompt includes the full previous agent's output), and — concretely — was the actual root cause of the bug above: the retrieval→hypothesis hand-off was the seam where a bad retrieval silently corrupted downstream reasoning, with no way for hypothesis to know retrieval had failed. The hypothesis→fix-proposal hand-off never caused a problem; diagnosing and proposing a fix are naturally sequential, tightly coupled steps. "Investigation" (find the code + figure out why) is naturally one continuous train of thought for a human engineer too — splitting it bought nothing and cost a real bug.

Merged retrieval + hypothesis into one `investigator_agent` (both tools, one task: list files, read the relevant one(s), state root cause + confidence in the same pass). Kept `fix_agent` separate — that boundary is worth preserving even though it's "just" prompt structure, because it cleanly isolates the one agent explicitly forbidden from claiming a change was applied, matching the propose-only principle above. Re-tested after merging: fully grounded result this time, no invented names at all — quoted the real `await db.apply_order(...)` call and the real `log.error("negative_balance_detected", ...)` line verbatim. The proposed fix itself wasn't fully correct (it added a redundant balance re-check using an already-stale value, which doesn't actually close the TOCTOU gap — a real concurrency-correct fix would need locking, which is exactly the kind of subtlety a human reviewer should catch, not something to auto-apply) — but the grounding problem that mattered is solved.

General lesson, not just specific to this project: don't add agent separation by default. Split a step into its own agent only when there's a concrete reason — a genuinely different toolset/data source, a need for independent/skeptical review (a critic checking another agent's own work), or a step that's actually multi-step/branching on its own (e.g. git-based multi-file tracing, planned for the next iteration, which may justify re-introducing a dedicated retrieval agent once it's no longer a 3-file lookup).

### Propose-only, never auto-apply

The fix-proposal agent's backstory and task explicitly state it is not authorized to apply changes — it drafts a diff and explanation for a human to review. This mirrors how real tools (Sentry AI, Copilot) draw this line: autonomous, unreviewed changes to running code/data is a known risk, not just caution for its own sake. If genuine autonomous *action* is wanted later, the safer scope for that is reversible infra remediation (auto-restart a crashed container, bump a pool size) — not auto-patching application code. Not built; flagged as a deliberate non-decision.

### Decoupled from the log-watching loop

`log_collector.py` is a single synchronous polling loop. Calling the CrewAI pipeline directly from `handle_error()` would block it for however long the three chained LLM calls take — any incident arriving during that window wouldn't be processed until the AI call finished. Instead, AI-worthy incidents go into a `queue.Queue()`; a background daemon thread (started once at startup) consumes it and runs the crew. `handle_error()` just does a non-blocking `queue.put()`.

### Code retrieval: a known, documented scale limitation

The retrieval agent reads `target_app`'s source via a Docker volume — `target_app/` is mounted read-only into `sentinel-agent` at `/app/target_app_src`. This is a deliberate toy-scale simplification, not a production pattern, and it's worth being explicit about why:

At real scale, mounting one shared agent's filesystem access into every other service's live container doesn't work — production containers are frequently source-stripped via multi-stage Docker builds (no source present to mount at all), and giving one observability agent live filesystem access into every team's running containers is a serious security/blast-radius problem. It violates this project's own "neither knows the other's internals" principle worse than the Docker-SDK-log-streaming approach rejected back in section 1 — that gave an agent access to container orchestration; this gives it access to source code directly.

The real pattern: fetch source via git/version-control APIs using the file path + line number from an error (decoupled from whatever's currently deployed), often backed by a pre-built searchable code index — the same idea as this project's own planned Week 3 vector memory, just applied to code instead of past incidents. **Planned follow-up:** switch the retrieval agent to git-based fetching in the next iteration; the volume mount is explicitly a placeholder, not the intended end state.

### Cost

Both input and output tokens are billed, separately. Three agents chained sequentially (`context=[earlier_task]`) means token usage compounds across the pipeline — later agents' inputs include earlier agents' full outputs. At this project's scale (a few thousand tokens per incident, incidents triggered manually/rarely) the cost is small, but it is real spend on a card, unlike using claude.ai or chatgpt.com's free chat tiers — the API is a separate, billed product.

### A pre-existing bug found while testing the cascade trigger: cascade detection never actually worked

Tried to manually trigger a confirmed cascade pattern (alternating `/external` and `/users/99` three times each) to verify the third AI trigger. It never confirmed — `cascade_counts` stayed completely empty no matter how many times the sequence ran. Root cause, in `error_detector.py`'s `process_error`: `self.last_error = error_event` was being set **before** `_handle_immediate`/`_handle_threshold` (which call `_detect_cascade`) ran. By the time `_detect_cascade` checked `self.last_error.event != current.event`, `self.last_error` had already been overwritten to equal the current event — so the comparison could never be true. **Cascade detection has been silently broken since Week 1** — present in the original design, never caught because nothing had tested it against a real alternating sequence until this session.

Fixed by moving the `self.last_error` update to after dispatch, so cascade detection compares against the *previous* error, not itself. Verified two ways: a deterministic standalone simulation of the exact sequence (confirms on the 3rd repetition as designed), and live against the running containers (`Cascade: external_api_timeout → user_not_found` printed, correctly queued for AI).

This is also the second real, previously-unknown bug found purely by testing rather than by reading the code (the first was `/external`'s unhandled `JSONDecodeError`, below) — both were "passed review" in the sense that the code looked reasonable on inspection, but neither had ever actually been exercised end-to-end before this session.

### A second pre-existing bug found in the same session: `/external` could fail silently with zero logging

While trying to trigger the cascade above, `/external` returned a raw, unlogged 500 instead of the expected `external_api_timeout`. Cause: `httpbin.org/delay/5` (a third-party service this project doesn't control) sometimes returns a fast, non-JSON/empty response instead of timing out — `response.json()` then throws an unhandled `JSONDecodeError`, which had no `except` clause and therefore never reached `log.error(...)` at all. SentinelAI's entire pipeline was blind to this failure mode — not misclassified, genuinely invisible.

Fixed with a broader `except Exception` clause logging a new `external_api_error` event (classified `threshold`, not AI-worthy — the exception message already names the failure clearly, same reasoning as `db_connection_error`). This is a good real-world lesson distinct from the cascade bug above: real external dependencies fail in ways the original code didn't anticipate, and "wrap every external call in error handling that actually logs, even for exceptions you didn't expect" is a genuine production lesson, not boilerplate paranoia.

### Prompting improvements: addressing shallow reasoning

First few live runs produced correct-but-shallow analysis — mostly restating the error message rather than naming a precise mechanism. Two changes to `_build_incident_summary` (`log_collector.py`) and the investigator task (`ai_engine.py`):
1. Added `APP_CONTEXT` — a short, factual description of the app's actual architecture (FastAPI + Postgres, what tables exist, that `create_order` reads then separately writes via `db.apply_order`) so the model isn't reasoning about a financial bug with zero domain framing. Deliberately phrased as a neutral architectural fact ("check whether this holds up under concurrent requests") rather than stating the conclusion outright — telling the model the bug already exists would make the demo hollow.
2. Told the investigator agent explicitly to follow cross-file function calls (e.g. if `main.py` calls `db.something(...)`, read `db.py` too) rather than stopping at the first file — the original prompt let it conclude from a single file even when the real mechanism spanned two.

### Expanded AI_WORTHY_EVENTS: external_api_timeout and external_api_error

Original classification excluded these as "self-explanatory" — wrong, on reflection. There's a real gap (the log only says "no response in 3s," not why), it just can't be closed by reading our own code *about the third party* (we have no visibility into `httpbin.org`'s internals). But there's a different, real, code-discoverable gap: `main.py`'s `/external` endpoint calls a **5-second-delay endpoint with a 3-second client timeout** — guaranteed to fail by construction, not actually "flaky third-party dependency." That mismatch is visible by reading `main.py` alone; the log line never states it.

Added both events to `AI_WORTHY_EVENTS`, and extended `APP_CONTEXT` to point the investigator at "is our own usage/defensive coding adequate" rather than "speculate about the third party." Verified live: confidence 1.0, correctly identified the 3s-vs-5s mismatch, proposed raising the timeout to 6s — a genuinely correct fix, not just plausible-sounding, for an insight nothing in this project had surfaced before this conversation.

General lesson: "is the log line self-explanatory" isn't really the right test for AI-worthiness on its own — better test is "does *our own code* contain a discoverable insight beyond the proximate symptom," even when the ultimate external cause is unknowable. db_pool_exhausted/db_deadlock/db_connection_error remain excluded specifically because no comparable code-level insight exists *yet* (no hold-time instrumentation) — not because the question itself is unanswerable in principle.

*(Redis and the traffic simulator sections to be added as each is built.)*
